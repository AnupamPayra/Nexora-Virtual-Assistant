# Nexora - Virtual Assistant ðŸ¤–

**Nexora** is my beginner-level Virtual Assistant project built with Python.  
It can perform simple but useful tasks like:  

- Open YouTube or Google in your browser
- Play music on Youtube
- Answer your questions using Gemini API (AI-powered) 
- Take a screenshot 
- Add reminders  

This is my learning project, and I plan to add more features in the future as I explore new technologies.
